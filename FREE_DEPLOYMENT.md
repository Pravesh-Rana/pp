# Deploy to Vercel - Free & Instant

## Step 1: Vercel Authentication
The Vercel CLI is asking you to authenticate. Here's what to do:

1. **Visit this URL in your browser:** 
   https://vercel.com/api/registration/login-with-github?mode=login

2. **Login with your GitHub account** (same one you used for the portfolio repo)

3. **Copy the verification code** shown in your browser

4. **Paste it in the Shell** where it says "Verification code:"

## Step 2: Deploy
After authentication, I'll deploy your portfolio instantly.

## Why Vercel?
- **Free hosting** for personal projects
- **Instant deployment** from this Replit
- **Custom domain** support (optional)
- **Automatic HTTPS** and CDN
- **No file uploads needed** - deploys directly from here

Your portfolio will be live at a vercel.app domain in under 60 seconds!
