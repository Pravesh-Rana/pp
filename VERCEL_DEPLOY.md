# Vercel Deployment - Ready to Go!

## Authentication Required

The Vercel CLI is ready to deploy your portfolio. Here's what you need to do:

### Step 1: Complete Authentication
1. **Visit:** https://vercel.com/api/registration/login-with-github?mode=login
2. **Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Copy the verification code** from your browser
4. **Paste it** in the Shell where it says "Verification code:"

### Step 2: Instant Deployment
After authentication, I'll run:
```bash
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

Your portfolio will be live immediately at a vercel.app domain!

## What Happens Next
- Vercel builds your React app automatically
- All your assets (photo, resume) are included
- Gets a custom URL like `portfolio-website-abc123.vercel.app`
- Free hosting with HTTPS and global CDN
- Future updates deploy automatically

Complete the authentication step and your professional portfolio will be live in under 60 seconds!
