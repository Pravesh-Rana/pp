# Enable GitHub Pages - Final Step

Your files are uploaded successfully! Now you need to enable GitHub Pages to make your portfolio live.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to your repository:** https://github.com/Pravesh-Rana/portfolio-website

2. **Click on "Settings"** (in the top menu of your repository)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (in the left sidebar)

4. **Under "Source":**
   - Select "Deploy from a branch" OR "GitHub Actions"
   - If you see "GitHub Actions" option, choose that
   - If not, select "Deploy from a branch" and choose "main" branch

5. **Click "Save"**

6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy

## Your Live Portfolio URL:
After enabling Pages, your portfolio will be available at:
**https://pravesh-rana.github.io/portfolio-website/**

## If GitHub Actions Option is Available:
That's the best choice because I've already configured the automated deployment workflow that will build your React app properly.

## Troubleshooting:
- If you don't see the "Pages" option in Settings, make sure your repository is public
- The first deployment might take 5-10 minutes
- You'll get an email when it's ready

Enable GitHub Pages now and your professional portfolio will be live!
